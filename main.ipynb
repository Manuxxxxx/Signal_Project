    "- $ MAX_I $ is the maximum possible pixel value (255 for 8-bit images).\n",
    "- **MSE** is the Mean Squared Error between the two images, defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```math\n",
    "MSE = \\frac{1}{M \\times N} \\sum_{x,y} \\left[ I_1(x, y) - I_2(x, y) \\right]^2\n",

    "### Process of the Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input Validation and Preprocessing:**\n",
    "   - **Dimension Check:** The function first verifies whether the two images have the same shape. If not, it resizes the second image to match the dimensions of the first.\n",
    "   - **Grayscale Conversion:** Both images are converted from RGB to grayscale, as SSIM and PSNR are typically calculated on single-channel images.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **SSIM Calculation:**\n",
    "   - The SSIM metric is computed using the grayscale images to assess the structural similarity between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **PSNR Calculation:**\n",
    "   - **MSE Calculation:** The Mean Squared Error between the two grayscale images is computed.\n",
    "   - **PSNR Formula:** If the MSE is zero, PSNR is set to infinity. Otherwise, PSNR is calculated using the logarithmic formula based on the MSE.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Output:**\n",
    "   - The function returns two values: the SSIM value (`ssim_value`) and the PSNR value (`psnr_value`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SSIM** provides a measure of the perceptual similarity between images by taking into account luminance, contrast, and structural differences.\n",
    "- **PSNR** quantifies the error between images, with higher values indicating better image quality.\n",
    "- Together, these metrics are essential for comparing image quality and guiding improvements in image processing tasks.\n"
